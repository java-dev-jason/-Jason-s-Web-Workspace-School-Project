# -Jason-s-Web-Workspace-School-Project
This is my first personal web project, created as part of a school assignment. While I'm not planning to pursue a career in web development, 
this project helped me build a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and how front-end technologies work. The goal was to learn by doing — not to build a production-grade site. 

The result is a personal portfolio site that visually presents my Java-based projects, using only HTML and CSS without external libraries or frameworks.

## 🛠 Project Structure
- index.html
  The landing page introduces who I am, what I’m working on, and highlights some key projects.
  It features animated backgrounds, floating decorative elements, hover effects, and responsive card layouts — all built with raw CSS.

- AllWorks.html
  This page goes into detail about each of my main Java projects, including:
  - A Password Strength Analyzer
  - A SHA-256 Hash Cracker
  - A Java Password Manager with MySQL & AES-256
  - A "Millionaire"-style Quiz Game using Swing
  - A Pomodoro Workflow Timer
  - A Satirical Smoking Simulator (Console Game)
 
Each project section includes:
- ✨ Feature list
- 📦 Tech stack
- 🧪 Example output
- 📁 File overview
- 🙋 About the purpose and learning behind it
  
## 🔍 Why This Project Exists
This web project acts as a visual portfolio and learning platform. It's not about showcasing web dev skills, 
but about organizing and presenting Java-based backend or console projects in a user-friendly way.

  💡 It’s a design-focused wrapper for what I enjoy: Java development.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (animations, responsive design, gradients)
- No JavaScript or frameworks — pure vanilla web code
