# -Jason-s-Web-Workspace-School-Project
This is my first personal web project, created as part of a school assignment. While I'm not planning to pursue a career in web development, this project helped me build a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and how front-end technologies work. The goal was to learn by doing â€” not to build a production-grade site. 

The result is a personal portfolio site that visually presents my Java-based projects, using only HTML and CSS without external libraries or frameworks.
